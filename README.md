# Leaky-Integrate-and-Fire-Model
## Overview
The **Leaky Integrate-and-Fire (LIF) model** is a fundamental computational framework for simulating neuronal networks that receive **fluctuating input currents**,closely mimicking the dynamics of biological neurons. <br>
This simulation captures essential spiking behavior and generates two key visualizations: <br>
the **Membrane Potential Plot**, which illustrates voltage fluctuations over time, and<br>
the **Raster Plot**, which represents the precise timing of neuronal spikes.<br>

## Installation & Dependencies
 the prerequisties of this project are:<br>
 **numpy** – For numerical computations<br>
 **matplotlib** – For visualization<br>

## Scientific Relevance
  This model is useful for:<br>
   **Neuroscience research** – The Study of neural dynamics, membrane potential fluctuations, and spike generation mechanisms. <br>
   **Computational neuroscience** – The Simulation of large-scale neuronal networks, providing insights into network dynamics and emergent behaviors <br>
   **Artificial Intelligence (AI)** –  Serving a foundational model for Spiking Neural Networks (SNNs) and contributing to neuromorphic computing and biologically inspired machine learning. <br>
