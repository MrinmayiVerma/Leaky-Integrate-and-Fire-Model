# Leaky-Integrate-and-Fire-Model
## Overview
The **Leaky Integrate-and-Fire (LIF) model** is a fundamental computational framework used for simulating neuronal networks where the neurons receive **fluctuating input currents** and closely mimicking the dynamics of biological neurons. <br>

The above simulation captures the essential spiking behavior of neurons and generates two key visualizations: <br>
the **Membrane Potential Plot**, which illustrates voltage fluctuations over time, and<br>
the **Raster Plot**, which represents the precise timing of neuronal spikes.<br>
